# QuadraticForm class/functionality for SAGE
SAGE/Python Source Code to define the QuadraticSpace, QuadraticLattice, and Squareclass classes for the [SAGE Open Source Computer algebra system](http://www.sagemath.org/), also used in the [CoCalc Collaborative Calculation in the Cloud](https://cocalc.com/) service. 

This code is given in the commit https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/11940 but appears to not yet be merged into the codebase.  SAGE open issues for my code are listed [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20hanke).
