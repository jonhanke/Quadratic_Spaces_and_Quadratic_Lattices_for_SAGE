# QuadraticSpace / QuadraticLattice / Squareclass class functionality for SAGE
SAGE/Python Source Code to define the QuadraticSpace, QuadraticLattice, and Squareclass classes for the [SAGE Open Source Computer algebra system](http://www.sagemath.org/), also used in the [CoCalc Collaborative Calculation in the Cloud](https://cocalc.com/) service. 

This code was submitted in the commit https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/11940.  

SAGE open issues for my code are listed [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20hanke).
